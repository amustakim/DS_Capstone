# DS_Capstone
In this capston project paper, we will analyze a data set that contains the credit card payment history and socio demographic attributes of a sample group of customers in a financial institution. We will then predict which of these customers will default in their credit card payments using four different predictive modeling methods that vary in complexity but are all implemented in the R statistical language. Prior to constructing those models, we will apply a set of universal data cleansing rules on the data based on a close reading of the data dictionary and then engineer new features that will allow us to normalize and benchmark payment, credit utilization and other metrics across individual customer records. Baseline predictive models such as these can inform the basic policy decisions in a consumer credit organization and it also enables students in this degree program to understand how machine learning techniques are applied in the real world.
