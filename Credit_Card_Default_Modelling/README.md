# Northwestern Data Science Capstone
This is the capston project paper for my Northwestern Data Science M.S. degree. It containts a detailed analysis of a credit card payment history and socio demographic attributes of a sample group of customers in a financial institution, in an effort to predict which of these customers will default in their credit card payments using four different predictive modeling methods that vary in complexity but are all implemented in the R statistical language. Prior to constructing those models, a set of universal data cleansing rules are applied on the data based on a close reading of the data dictionary and then new features are engineered that  allow one to normalize and benchmark payment, credit utilization and other metrics across individual customer records. Baseline predictive models such as these can inform the basic policy decisions in a consumer credit organization and it also enables students in this degree program to understand how machine learning techniques are applied in the real world.
