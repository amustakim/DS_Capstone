# Northwestern Data Science Capstone
These are the final submissions for my Northwestern Data Science M.S. Degree Capstone Project.

In the model development guide you will find a detailed analysis of the credit card payment history of a sample group of customers in a financial institution. This is done in an effort to predict which of these customers will default in their next credit card payments using four different predictive modeling methods that vary in complexity but are all implemented in the R statistical language. Prior to constructing those models, a set of universal data cleansing rules are applied on the data based on a close reading of the data dictionary (see link to data dictionary below) and then new features are engineered that allow the model to normalize and benchmark payment, credit utilization and other metrics across individual customer records. 

In the performance validation guide you will find a systematic approach to how the performance of the chosen model is measured in a production environment once its deployed and how that model stacks up against a test data set.

Baseline predictive models such as these can inform the basic policy decisions in a consumer credit organization and it also enables students in this degree program to understand how machine learning techniques are applied in the real world.
